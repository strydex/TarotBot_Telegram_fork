# TarotBot_Telegram
Telegram bot for receiving tarot card layouts. Written using aiogram3.

To use the bot you must create a config.py file and create two variables in it: BOT_TOKEN, PAYMENTS_TOKEN.
You can find these tokens in the telegram bot @BotFather. 
Also, at the moment, each new user is given a balance of 100,000 rubles to test all functions.
